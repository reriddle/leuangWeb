        <p>I build things with code.<br>
            <br>
            When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, I'm usually building minitures, trying my hand at game development and
            and raising sheep in Harvest Moon.
        </p>

        <h3>Database Developer, Bissell Centre</h3>
        <p>Ensuring database was up to date with accurate information</p>
        <h2>Web Developer<h4>
        <p>Here is the first web based game I ever worked on. For this project the Edmonton Public Library 
            asked for a small game that was safe for all ages and accesible to everyone!

        <h2>Data Analytics</h2>
        <p>For a final project we created scraped data from a large
             variety of sources including: Edmonton Public Library,
            Twitter, Reddit and Goodreads. Using this data we looked
            to find interesting trends in Edmonton user trends.</p>
